# builder.io.demo

his is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Next.js is an open-source web development framework created by Vercel enabling React-based web applications with server-side rendering and generating static websites. We also use [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started), which is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives us the building blocks to build React applications.
